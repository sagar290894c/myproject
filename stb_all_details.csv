Baie Lazare beach, where majestic spirits are connected. 

During one of his expeditions back in 1742, the famous French explorer Lazare Picault, attracted by the heavenly beach and the enchanting sounds of wind and ocean, decided to set his anchor in the bay, which was thereafter named Baie Lazare after him. 

However, Lazare was not the first explorer to be drawn to this mesmerising beach. Since the dawn of time, sea turtles have been returning to the precise location where they were born, thus it is no wonder that one of the sea turtles, the famous Pico, has been visiting its home place, Baie Lazare, ever since its conception on the beach.

Subsequently, Baie Lazare has been the rendezvous of enigmatic creatures, bonded by kindred quests. The legends of Pico and Picault at Baie Lazare endure as we greet voyagers to experience the uniqueness of the beach. It is the quintessence of Seychelles.

This unique combination creates a hotspot of biodiversity. Cosmoledo Atoll consists of various scattered islands and is home to large populations of endemic birds like boobies, terns, and Frigate birds.

Three other islands lie in close proximity to each other on the northern rim of the atoll, Déposés, Ile du Milieu and Lapins. Banc du Sables is the most easterly island and Goëlettes is the most southerly island. The lagoon has a maximum depth of 14.6 meters. It was named in honor of Sir Robert Farquhar in 1824, appointed governor of Mauritius when it was captured from the French (in 1810). Earlier visitors had named it after Portuguese explorer Joao da Nova who commanded that nation’s third expedition to India during which he encountered Farquhar (in 1504)

Goëlettes is the most interesting for birds, including a huge seasonal colony of Sooty Terns. Roseate Tern (the most southerly breeding site in Seychelles) and Brown Noddy also breed. Red-footed Booby breed mainly on South Island, including the only breeding population of white-tailed brown morph in Seychelles. In 2006, ICS recorded a previously unknown colony of Black-naped Terns, the largest population in Seychelles. Studies by Seychelles Fishing Authority have shown that the abundance of some grouper species is three times greater than in the north Amirantes and up to thirty times than in the granitic. The density of Napoleon Wrasse is phenomenal, possibly the highest in the world. On the edge of the reef, at certain times of year, there are spawning aggregations of thousands of Camouflage Grouper and Brown-marbled Grouper.

The remote islands of Poivre Atoll remained undiscovered until the 1770’s and thus the landscape has provided a quiet reprieve for various species.
The islands of Poivre were first visited in 1770 and named by Chevalier du Roslan after his ship. It was later discovered that he was confused with Desroches Island and the island was renamed after Pierre Poivre, the Governor of Île de France and Réunion.
Pierre Poivre also played an important role in introducing spices to the Seychelles and other Indian Ocean islands, which is why he became known as the famous “Peter Pepper”. Throughout the years, the atoll was used for farming vanilla, cattle and pigs.

Once explored, the islands were used for vanilla, nuts, maize, cattle and pig farming. In recent years, the atoll’s landscapes have become a popular nesting ground for bird species like Chinese and Blue Heron, Whimbrels, fodies, noddies, Greater Frigate birds and Fairy Terns.

We are doing cold-pressed juices using a hydraulic press machine which extracts the juice of fruits and vegetables without creating heat, and therefore keeps all enzymes, vitamins and nutrients intact. We also make smoothies, smoothie bowls, nut mylks, raw food and healthy snacks.

“We aim to provide to the population and tourists an easy and healthy drink and food option. We also specialise in Detox cleanses, a juice diet program of 1 to 5 days. It detoxifies your body, gets rid of cravings, and you gain energy while giving a rest to your digestive system.”

 All our recipes are created with a combination of fruits and vegetables that complement each other and are based on nutritional benefits. Then the process is simple. Once we’ve decided on the recipe and produce, we wash and disinfect the produce, weigh them according to the recipe, shred, press and bottle the juice. Everything is done in our lab.”

Each item is the result of an in-depth search for vegetable fibres, berries, flowers and other “pieces of nature” which are all processed using ancient techniques. Lastly, a touch of sophisticated creativity transforms each object into an envoy of the beauty of these islands. Antik Colony, a constant source of new ideas, seeks out and re-elaborates tradition and recovers ancient styles of which all traces had been lost. 
Pareos, bags and accessories decorated with ethnic designs and printed using the batik method, evoke the warm colours of the tropics, just as the perfumed essences and cosmetic lines transmit the fragrance of local flora. The soap bars, the spices or the jams and jellies are also all absolutely genuine and pure, with no added chemicals. They are available in sophisticated packaging that evokes the “Old Seychelles” style.

Departing passengers can buy our products at the STC duty free shop in the departure lounge at the Seychelles International airport.

Here giant palms rustle overhead as you meander through this ancient forest filled with many endemic species of palm and rare fauna, such as the Seychelles Black Parrot, the tiger chameleon and the diminutive Seychelles tree frog.

Vallée de Mai is also home to the Coco de Mer palm; the seed is the largest nut in the world and has been treasured as a collectable and mystical aphrodisiac for centuries. Let our Guides unravel the secrets of this magical forest for you.

It was once believed – in the distant lands where these giant seeds would wash ashore –  that the Coco de Mer originated from a sacred forest under the sea. Today, we know better, and Vallée de Mai – believed by some to be the original site of the Garden of Eden – is where these magnificent palms grow.",TOUR,"https://assets.parrapi.com/images/c135f7bb11e0eb9c59d23e4598358a26.jpeg?rect=211,0,3379,2534&w=280&h=210&rot=360","-4.6223952,55.44976699999999","[{'address_type': 'PHYSICAL', 'address_line': 'Revolution Avenue', 'address_line2': 'Michel Building', 'islandType': 'Inner', 'island': 'Mahe', 'islandArea': 'Victoria', 'city': '', 'state': '', 'postcode': '', 'country': 'Seychelles'}]",1.0,https://api.parrapi.com/pixel?productId=645c8c4811b8b45c8fa1c22e&distributorId=5f452f5e6b6fbb21dff8dd49&language=en&syndicationMethod=API,TOUR,WBTOURS,
